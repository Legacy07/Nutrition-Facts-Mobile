Bugs ----
listview - cannot append the list view from food nutritions fragment into breakfast tab because it gets the data from dynamic getter from main 
and second problem is that the breakfast tab fragment reloads itself every time i try to add food because i need to open a different fragment.


Need to do ---
-Once breakfast tab is done, do lunch dinner and sauces tab.
-design the nutrition summary fragment which is gonna hold the total macros, calorie breakdown and the chart relative to it. RDI and calorie breakdown charts.
-delete the current db then import the custom db and make an ability to backup the db 
-customize home page
-add appropriate loading screen
-change navigation bar android logo to kcal
